               <p> At over a metre in length and weighing as much as an adult human, the capybara is the largest rodent in the world. A stocky, somewhat pig-like animal, it is characterised by a large, blunt head, heavy muzzle, short, robust legs and rudimentary tail. 
                   
                    <p>The hair is coarse and sparse, and varies in colour between dark brown, reddish and yellowish brown, occasionally with some black on the face, the outer surface of the limbs, and on the rump. The capybara shows a number of adaptations to a partly aquatic lifestyle. </p>
              <p> Did you know: The common name of the Capybara is thought to mean "Master of the Grasses", whilst its scientific name comes from the Greek word for water hog.</p>
